    <h2>Shrimp Fried Rice</h2>

        fresh rice can fry up a bit mushy. Pretty much anthing can go into fried rice -usually a combination
        of veggies, beaten egg, and any protein of choice, in this case a shrimp.

                and let fry for 30 seconds. Then flip and fry on the otherside for another 30 seconds.

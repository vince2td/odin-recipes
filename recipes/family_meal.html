    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li><p>Start with a large pot of salted water over high heat(for the spaghetti).</p></li>
        <li><p>In a small suace pot, add the half cup of olive oil, 8 - 10 cloves of garlic, and a handful of fresh basil.</p></li>
        <li><p>On medium to low heat, let the mixture comes to a slow boil for 1-3 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove the basil and set it aside while you finish cooking the garlic to a light golden color.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove the pan from the heat, add the basil to the pot and allow the mixture to cool.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the tomatoes, garlic, and basil to a food processor or blender with 2 tablespoons of the oil. The infused oil helps the sauce emulsify into a silky smooth texture and adds extra flavor.</p></li>
        <li><p>Puree until it reaches your desired smoothness. Season with salt and pepper, and then heat the mixture over medium heat in a deep skillet until it comes to a boil. Reduce the heat, and simmer the sauce until thickened.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the spaghetti to the boiling salted water and cook until it's al dente.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the chopped herbs to the sauce, and taste for seasoning. Add more salt as needed. Just be careful here because you may be using the salty pasta water to loosen the sauce, and you donâ€™t want to overseason.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the pasta to the thickened sauce and toss to coat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook until the pasta is al dente, adding pasta water to help loosen the sauce as it cooks with the pasta.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add some fresh chopped basil or parsley, taste for seasoning, and add more salt as needed before serving.</p></li>
    </ol>
